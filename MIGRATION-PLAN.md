# Mixcore Migration Plan

This document outlines the plan for migrating the Mixcore application from AngularJS to Next.js with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui. It includes task assignments, priorities, and a timeline for the migration process.

## Migration Strategy

Our migration approach follows these key principles:

1. **Incremental Migration**: Migrate the application piece by piece, starting with the most critical components and pages.
2. **Prioritize Core Functionality**: Focus first on core functionality that is essential for the application.
3. **Maintain Consistency**: Ensure UI/UX consistency throughout the migration process.
4. **Improve as We Go**: Take the opportunity to improve UX, performance, and accessibility during migration.

## Dependencies & Risk Management

### Critical Dependencies

- Authentication system must be completed before user management features
- Form component library must be completed before content creation pages
- Data table components must be completed before list views
- API services must be implemented before corresponding UI features
